Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't.

To install Homebrew, you need to

- open a Terminal, usually using your launcher, so Cmd+Space, type in `Terminal`, press Enter
- copy & paste this bit of text into the window

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once that's done, paste in

```
brew install hugo
```
