All the material we go through will be on this site, as will links to all tools and products used in this course.
We&amp;rsquo;ve tried to design this course to be open-ended, so that if some of you have the time and desire to explore further, you can. Most topics will have suggestions for extra activities and options to expand, however, none of these will be assumed in further lessons.</description></item><item><title>New Site</title><link>https://uswitch.github.io/codef-syllabus/lesson-1/new-site/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 15:47:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://uswitch.github.io/codef-syllabus/lesson-1/new-site/</guid><description>Creating your first website Windows Please create a folder named Sites in C:\Hugo, i.e., when you&amp;rsquo;re done, you should have a structure like C: &amp;gt; Hugo &amp;gt; Sites.
